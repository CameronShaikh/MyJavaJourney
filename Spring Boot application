A Spring Boot application is a Java-based web application that is built using the Spring framework. 
It is designed to make it easier to create and deploy web applications by providing a streamlined development experience and a set of pre-configured components and dependencies.


Here is an example Java Spring code with comments:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Import necessary libraries
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

// Indicate that this is a Spring Boot application
@SpringBootApplication
// Define a REST controller for handling HTTP requests
@RestController
public class ExampleSpringApp {

    // Define a GET endpoint at the root of the application
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    // Define the main method to run the application
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ExampleSpringApp.class, args);
    }
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we have created a simple Spring Boot application with a single endpoint at the root of the application. 
When a user makes an HTTP GET request to the root endpoint, the application responds with the string "Hello, World!".

Let's go through the code in more detail:

We import the necessary libraries to use Spring Boot.
We annotate the class with @SpringBootApplication to indicate that this is a Spring Boot application.
We annotate the class with @RestController to indicate that this class will handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
We define a single endpoint using the @GetMapping annotation, which indicates that this endpoint will handle incoming HTTP GET requests to the root of the application.
The helloWorld method simply returns a string response.
We define the main method, which starts the Spring Boot application and runs the ExampleSpringApp class.

This is a very simple example of how to create a Spring Boot application, but it demonstrates the basic structure and components that you'll need in most applications.
